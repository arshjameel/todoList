# Todo List
A classic todo app. Users are able to create lists and then add various tasks 
in those lists. The lists show date/time of creation. The tasks are organized 
by priority levels and due dates set by the user.

### Features
- Dynamic loading of popup windows that ask the user for information
- Modular layout javascript pages to acheieve low coupling 
- Webpack bundling

### Teck stack
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Webpack 5
- [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) for date manipulation

### Note 
1. The color palette used for this program was loosely inspired by the 
["Gruvbox"](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox?tab=readme-ov-file) colorscheme
2. The UI design was inspired by the ["Neobrutalist"](https://www.neobrutalism.dev/) 
   philosophy
